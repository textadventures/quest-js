QuestJS
=======

**THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER BEING DEVELOPED OR MAINTAINED!**

QuestJS takes in a [Quest 5](https://github.com/textadventures/quest) .quest file
and spits out a folder full of HTML, CSS and JS. It was used for turning Quest games into apps, as the output can be wrapped using tools like PhoneGap.

The source is being kept online here for the moment for reference, but it is **no longer being developed or maintained**.

---
# QuestJS no longer compiles games made with the current version of Quest (5.7.2)!

Changes were made to Quest's source code, and QuestJS will not compile playable games anymore.

The TAKE command was altered in Quest 5.7.2, and the player will NOT be able to TAKE any objects in a game compiled with QuestJS!!!
